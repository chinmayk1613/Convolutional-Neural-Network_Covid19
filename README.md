Convolutional Neural Network is the class of deep learning which is mostly used in computer vision technilogies. Unlike the traditional algorithms CNN has two sets of operations called "Convolution" and "Pooling" which results the image into desire features and based on this features understanding and classifying the images. Below are the important layers which is used in CNN.

<code>__1. Convolutional Layer:__</code> In this layer we create a 'kernel' of specific size(5X5 or 7X7) and placed over the image. This operation is actually dot product of original pixel of images within that kernel size and the values defined in the kernel. After the operation result will be single pixel that is overall average or reprentative of the seletec kernel size pixels.
